# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-

Overview -
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to understand purchasing patterns, engagement levels, and customer segments. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that help businesses improve customer retention, identify high-value customers, and support data-driven decision-making.
The project follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI, along with a final presentation created using Gamma.

📁 Dataset -
The dataset contains customer-level transaction and behavioral data.
Each row represents a unique customer interaction or purchase.
Key attributes include:
Customer ID
Purchase Amount
Purchase Frequency (Days)
Previous Purchase Days (Recency)
Product / Item Purchased

🛠 Tools & Technologies -
Python → Data loading, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning
SQL Server → Querying, aggregation, and KPI extraction
Power BI → Interactive dashboard and visual storytelling
Gamma → Presentation (PPT) for insights and recommendations

🔄 Project Steps -
